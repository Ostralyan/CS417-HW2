Assignment 2 Documentation


We are submitting the following documents:
1. rpopen.c This processes the arguements and connects to the host passing in arguements to the remote server and reads the write back from server.
2. rpopen-demo.c file Test file 
3. rpserver.c Forks and execl's while listening to additional incoming clients. Processes the popen command on the server side and writes to client
4. port.h file specifies the defines the service port (default port)
5. Makefile


 How to compile and run the code:
1. cd into the folder
2. $make
3. $export PPORT=port_of_server
4. $export PHOST=name_of_server
5. $./rpserver
6. $./rpopen-demo
7. also supports ./rpserver [-p port] but on client side PPORT must be specified
8. if not host or ports are specified, default host = "localhost" & default port = SERVICE_PORT from port.h

Tests ran to validate the software:
The software runs with the rpope-demo.c file. 
It also works in the case of reading empty messages.
./rpserver with no arguements goes to default
./rpserver with -p port uses input as port but cannot modify ./rpopen-demo to match server port.
