Assignment 2 Documentation


We are submitting the following documents:
1. rpopen.c  file contains code for ropen function. The ropen function uses sockets at the operating systems level to allow a program to open the output stream of a remote program
2. rpopen-demo.c file is a demo program that uses ropen function
3. rpserver.c file is a server file for the server program. The server continuiously loops waiting for connections.
4. port.h file specifies the defines the service port (default port)
5. Makefile file assumes that all ropen.c is a client logic program and the server is in the a file called rpserver.c The make will also build a demo client called ropen-demo from a file called ropen-demo.c. Makefile will compile the executable versions of ropen.c, ropen-demo.c, and rpserver.c.


 How to compile and run the code:
1. cd into the folder
2. $make
3. $export PPORT=port_of_server
4. $export PHOST=name_of_server
5. $./rpserver
6. $./rpopen-demo
7. also supports ./rpserver [-p port] but on client side PPORT must be specified
8. if not host or ports are specified, default host = "localhost" & default port = SERVICE_PORT from port.h

Tests ran to validate the software:
The software runs with the rpope-demo.c file. It also works in the case of reading empty messages.
